#From the resulting image in cca.py, we can see that other regions that do not contain the license plate are also mapped. In order to eliminate these, we will use some characteristics of a typical license plate to remove them:
#1. they are rectangular in shape
#2. The width is more than the height
#3. The proportion of the width of the license plate region to the full image ranges between 15% and 40%
#4. The proportion of the height of the license plate region to the full image is between 8% & 20%






#the measure.label function scans the input image (which should be binary: foreground pixels are 1 or True or white, and background pixels are 0 or False or black). A binary image is a 2D array where each value is either a 0 or 1, for background or foreground, black or white. The output of this function takes that binary image and labeles regions with a lot of connected white pixels. It outputs a 2D array where the first grouped region is all assigned a value of 1, the second grouped region is all assigned a value of 2, the third grouped region is all assigned a value of 3, etc. And the background pixels are still 0.
#for example
# Input (binary image)
#   [[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#   [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
#   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

# Output (labeled image)
#   [[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#   [0, 1, 1, 0, 2],
#   [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]


#y0, x0, y1, x1 = regions.bbox
#y0: Top row index of the bounding box (start of the region, vertically)
#x0: Left column index of the bounding box (start of the region, horizontally)
#y1: Bottom row index (end of the region, vertically; exclusive)
#x1: Right column index (end of the region, horizontally; exclusive)
